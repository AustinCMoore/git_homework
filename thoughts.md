//I need to improve my time management skills
//I was able to troubleshoot a problem in terminal without breaking anything!
//I will use the pomodoro method (doing it now!)
//I will ask more questions
//Oh my gosh, I have had a tremendous amount of support and I would feel bad naming just one person who has helped me the last couple weeks!
